# Machine Learning

- Understanding and building methods that learn that is methods that
  leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks.
- It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.
- ML algorithms build a model based on sample data (training data) in order
  to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

- A subset of ML is closely related to computational statistics
    - focuses on making predictions using computers
    - but not all ML is statistical learning

- The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application
  domain to the field of machine learning.

- Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on **exploratory data analysis**
  through unsupervised learning.

- Some implementations of ML use data and neural networks in a way that mimics the working of biological brain.
- In its application across business problems, ML is also referred to as **predictive analysis**.
